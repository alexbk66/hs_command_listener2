Small Helper integration for AKHomeAssistant HomeSeer plugin.

It doesn't need any configuration.  It only creates one 'text' entity "text.hs_command_input2" which listens for commands from AKHomeAssistant HomeSeer plugin to create helper entities.  You can verify if the integration is installed properly by checking the entity "text.hs_command_input2".

Any issies - please report in HomeSeer forum via the above link.
